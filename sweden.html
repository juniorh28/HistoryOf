          <h3><u>History of: Sweden</u></h3>
          <p>Sweden is a powerful nation that is full of rich culture, magnificent landscape, and strong historical influence. The country is located in Northern Europe in a region called Scandinavia, made up of Norway and Denmark.

          <h3><u>Geography</u></h3>
          <p>The country of Sweden is mostly flat with an abundance of forest and islands. It’s really snowy and mountainous in the northwestern part of the country which separates it from Norway and has a long coastline next to the Gulf of Bothnia and the Baltic Sea allowing it to trade with various different countries. Sweden has always, since its existence been a sea fishing and trading country. Its large abundance of fishing resources contributed to the creation of Vikings and raised Sweden to become a major power during the 7th and 8th century. </p>

          <h3><u>Norse Religion</u></h3>
          <p>The Swedes along with all other scandinavian tribes before and during the age of the viking followed the Norse religion. The Norse religion is polytheistic, there are two distinct groups of gods, Aesir and Vanir. The Aesir are chaotic and warlike, ruling over Asgard, while Vanir are peace-loving gods and are associated with fertility and nature, ruling over Vanaheimr. In the Norse faith, there exist nine worlds, Asgard, Alfheim, Midgard, Vanaheim, Jotunheim, Niflheim, Muspellsheim, Svartalfheim, and Helheim. All of these worlds are connected to one another through Yggdrasil, a cosmic tree of life that connects all of the worlds through its branches and roots. All living people are leaves of Yggdrasil, leaves that fall represent lives lost, while new budding leaves are new life that was born. The main god of the faith was Odin, he was called the All-Father because he was the father keen with knowledge and wisdom. He was also the ruler of Asgard. Odin saw in his prophecy Ragnarok, the end of the world, in a war between Aesir god against Hel and Loki, the trickster god.

          <h3><u>Norse Funerals</u></h3>
          <p>In an effort to combat Ragnarok, Odin would send Valkyries (battle maiden angels) known as the “Chooser of the Slain”, to choose half of the warriors of Midgard (earth) and send them to Valhalla to feast with the gods until Ragnarok. For this reason many viking fought violently, believing an honorable death in battle to be a sure way to Valhalla. The other half would go to Folkvangr, a field ruled by the goddess Freya.  Many important figures such as jarls (kings) upon death, would be buried with their ships, surrounded by all their wealth and slaves to accompany them in the afterlife. Others would be burned on a pyre and some would recieve stone burial. Those who didn’t die in battle but were considered too good would go to Helgafjell, known as the “holy mountain”. Lastly those who died dishonorably such as from old age would be sent to Helheim, a cold and frozen place ruled by the goddess Hel. In the society, there would be a seven day mourning period before a celebration, in which talks of property and inheritance of the deceased would be passed. Some would have a runestone raised in their honor, a runestone was a large bedrock or boulder with runes (Germanic alphabet) that serves as a monument. While they were used for people, they were also used for other accomplishments such as battles or completing construction.

          <h3><u>Vikings and the Conquest of Europe</u></h3>
          <p>The country of Sweden was home to many different tribes belonging to different ethnic groups but united under the Swedes. It is still a mystery as to when the tribal kingdoms united but the unification brought an advancement in technology. The creation of bronze allowed for better tools to create ships as well as powerful weapons. The Swedes expanded into central Europe and plundered many settlements and kingdoms. They sailed across the Baltic sea and plundered many countries such as modern day Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. Many of the Vikings who plundered those regions eventually settled there and they were known as the people of Rus. The land of Rus eventually grew to compose parts of what we know today as northern Ukraine, north-western Russia and Belarus, parts of Finland, Poland, Slovakia, and the Baltic states. The Swedes would eventually lose control of the land to the Mongols during the 13th century and it would eventually lead to the creation of Russia.

          <h3><u>The Kalmar Union</u></h3>
          <p>While the Swedish Viking attacked central Europe, their neighbor, Denmark was sailing across the North Sea attacking England, France, and Spain. This won Denmark a lot of power and strength which would eventually lead Denmark’s Queen, Margaret I, to become the leader of Kalmar Union between itself, Norway, and Sweden in 1397. The Kalmar Union was a single monarchy that united the three countries and gave the Danish king absolute power between the three countries. Because the Danish king’s order was absolute, this brought internal strife between King Albert of Sweden and the leading nobility that supported his ascension. King Albert wanted to reduce the leading nobility’s assets and landholding but the nobles wouldn’t let it happen. They claimed the land as part of Danish queen’s property. This led to fighting between the Swedes and the Danish in 1389, the Danish were victorious. However, The Union wasn’t officially formed until 1397, when the Danish promised the Swedes power to hold a position of authority (excluding the throne of their country) and influence in the court as long as the Danish always stay the monarch of the Union.</p>
