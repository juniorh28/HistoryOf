          <h3><u>History of: Sweden</u></h3>
          <p>Sweden is a powerful nation that is full of rich culture, magnificent landscape, and strong historical influence. The country is located in Northern Europe in a region called Scandinavia, made up of Norway and Denmark.
</p>
      </div>
      <div>
          <h3><u>Geography</u></h3>
          <p>The country of Sweden is mostly flat with an abundance of forest and islands. It’s really snowy and mountainous in the northwestern part of the country which separates it from Norway and has a long coastline next to the Gulf of Bothnia and the Baltic Sea allowing it to trade with various different countries. Sweden has always, since its existence been a sea fishing and trading country. Its large abundance of fishing resources contributed to the creation of Vikings and raised Sweden to become a major power during the 7th and 8th century. </p>

          <h3><u>Norse Religion</u></h3>
          <p>The Swedes along with all other scandinavian tribes before and during the age of the viking followed the Norse religion. The Norse religion is polytheistic, there are two distinct groups of gods, Aesir and Vanir. The Aesir are chaotic and warlike, ruling over Asgard, while Vanir are peace-loving gods and are associated with fertility and nature, ruling over Vanaheimr. In the Norse faith, there exist nine worlds, Asgard, Alfheim, Midgard, Vanaheim, Jotunheim, Niflheim, Muspellsheim, Svartalfheim, and Helheim. All of these worlds are connected to one another through Yggdrasil, a cosmic tree of life that connects all of the worlds through its branches and roots. All living people are leaves of Yggdrasil, leaves that fall represent lives lost, while new budding leaves are new life that was born. The main god of the faith was Odin, he was called the All-Father because he was the father keen with knowledge and wisdom. He was also the ruler of Asgard. Odin saw in his prophecy Ragnarok, the end of the world, in a war between Aesir god against Hel and Loki, the trickster god. 
</p>
      </div>
      <div>
          <h3><u>Norse Funerals</u></h3>
          <p>In an effort to combat Ragnarok, Odin would send Valkyries (battle maiden angels) known as the “Chooser of the Slain”, to choose half of the warriors of Midgard (earth) and send them to Valhalla to feast with the gods until Ragnarok. For this reason many viking fought violently, believing an honorable death in battle to be a sure way to Valhalla. The other half would go to Folkvangr, a field ruled by the goddess Freya.  Many important figures such as jarls (kings) upon death, would be buried with their ships, surrounded by all their wealth and slaves to accompany them in the afterlife. Others would be burned on a pyre and some would recieve stone burial. Those who didn’t die in battle but were considered too good would go to Helgafjell, known as the “holy mountain”. Lastly those who died dishonorably such as from old age would be sent to Helheim, a cold and frozen place ruled by the goddess Hel. In the society, there would be a seven day mourning period before a celebration, in which talks of property and inheritance of the deceased would be passed. Some would have a runestone raised in their honor, a runestone was a large bedrock or boulder with runes (Germanic alphabet) that serves as a monument. While they were used for people, they were also used for other accomplishments such as battles or completing construction.

          <h3><u>Vikings and the Conquest of Europe</u></h3>
          <p>The country of Sweden was home to many different tribes belonging to different ethnic groups but united under the Swedes. It is still a mystery as to when the tribal kingdoms united but the unification brought an advancement in technology. The creation of bronze allowed for better tools to create ships as well as powerful weapons. The Swedes expanded into central Europe and plundered many settlements and kingdoms. They sailed across the Baltic sea and plundered many countries such as modern day Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. Many of the Vikings who plundered those regions eventually settled there and they were known as the people of Rus. The land of Rus eventually grew to compose parts of what we know today as northern Ukraine, north-western Russia and Belarus, parts of Finland, Poland, Slovakia, and the Baltic states. The Swedes would eventually lose control of the land to the Mongols during the 13th century and it would eventually lead to the creation of Russia.

          <h3><u>The Kalmar Union</u></h3>
          <p>While the Swedish Viking attacked central Europe, their neighbor, Denmark was sailing across the North Sea attacking England, France, and Spain. This won Denmark a lot of power and strength which would eventually lead Denmark’s Queen, Margaret I, to become the leader of Kalmar Union between itself, Norway, and Sweden in 1397. The Kalmar Union was a single monarchy that united the three countries and gave the Danish king absolute power between the three countries. Because the Danish king’s order was absolute, this brought internal strife between King Albert of Sweden and the leading nobility that supported his ascension. King Albert wanted to reduce the leading nobility’s assets and landholding but the nobles wouldn’t let it happen. They claimed the land as part of Danish queen’s property. This led to fighting between the Swedes and the Danish in 1389, the Danish were victorious. However, The Union wasn’t officially formed until 1397, when the Danish promised the Swedes power to hold a position of authority (excluding the throne of their country) and influence in the court as long as the Danish always stay the monarch of the Union.</p>

          <h3><u>Gustav and Independence</u></h3>
          <p>The Kalmar Union caused heavy strain on the relation between Denmark and Sweden. The Danish would constantly attack Sweden’s trading partners which damaged the Swedish economy. Gustav Vasa, a Swedish noble, challenged Christian II, King of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Gustav  received financial backing from Lubeck, in exchange for large commercial privileges which Gustav saw as an extortion.  In 1521, Gustav Vasa led a successful rebellion against the Danish for independence, pushing them off the peninsula. Free from the Union, Sweden crowned Gustav I, king of Sweden. In order to pay back his deal with Lubeck, Gustav imposed heavy taxes and used money from the Roman Catholic Church’s wealth. This led to the reformation in Sweden.

          <h3><u>Rise of the Swedish Empire</u></h3>
          <p>Sweden’s independence allowed the country to expand further and would eventually give birth to many great generals who would lead Sweden to become a major power. The Swedish empire started with Gustavus Adolphus who modernized the Swedish army. His army was the earliest to use paper cartridges for firearms, this greatly increases the speed and reliability of the weapons. He also led the Hakkapeliitta, fine Finnish cavalrymen who fired their pistol as they approached the enemies and drew their swords when they made contact. Gustavus expanded the country greatly; the country would reach its heights around the mid 17th century having control over territories such as Finland, Estonia, Latvia, and northern Germany. For this, he received the nickname, “Lion of the North.” Sweden expanded far beyond its continent, colonizing lands from North America from the coast of New York up to Albany and in Wilmington Delaware, and Africa, colonizing parts of modern day Ghana. During the Thirty Years’ War, the land around the Baltics, controlled by the Holy Roman empire was weak, so Sweden took it as an opportunity to strike. Having control of such a vast amount of countries came with a price. </p>

          <h3><u>Decline of the Empire and the Great Northern War</u></h3>
          <p>The decline of the empire came around the beginning of the 18th century. When King Charles XI died in 1697, there was a major alliance between Denmark, Poland, Russia, Prussian Empire, and Norway to defeat Sweden and gain some of its territories for themselves. Believing Charles XII, age 17, was too inexperienced, the alliance thought they could easily defeat Sweden. However, Charles XII, also known as Carolus Rex, would defend the country from multiple attacks, mostly by Russia. He led a powerful troop called Caroleans. They were trained not to retreat, but only to charge. This brought fear to many foes and would break morales and disrupt enemy lines. Following the victory over Russia, Rex went on the offensive and marched his army against them. Russia had a strategy called the “Scorched earth” tactic, which involved burning everything they lost so that it would be of no use to the enemy. Following a harsh winter also, the Swedish found themselves against a well prepared Russian army. After losing too many men to the battle and winter, Rex retreated to the Ottoman Empire. Peter I from Russia demanded his eviction. After the sultan refused the Russian request, Russia decided to invade the Ottomans Empire. The war between the two nations ended in an agreement, Russian retreats and gave back the land they took and the Ottoman had to evict Rex. Not wanting to leave, Charles XII tried to convince the sultan to partake in an Ottoman-Swedish assault on Russia. The sultan ended his kindness and had the king arrested. The two fought a skirmish until Rex fled back to Sweden on a 14-day ride. In Northern Germany, Swedish troops were trapped in a fight with the coalition. Sweden was at war with most of Northern Europe and couldn’t defend their territories. They had to retreat, losing their footing in northern Europe. Both Prussia and Great Britain demanded territories from Sweden in return for neutrality. After Sweden’s refusal, Prussia declared war on Sweden. Sweden prevented British entrance to the Baltic sea which caused Great Britain to join in on the war too. Sweden had to retreat, losing most of the land they conquered including most of Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. They were unable to defend northern Germany and lost that too. Rex would go on one last offensive attacking Norway (owned by Denmark at the time) and decided to fight a war in Norway to separate and end the Norway-Denmark peace treaty. His campaign would end there as he was killed in battle. This led to a series of peace treaties in 1719-21 and created the border of Sweden we know of today.

          <h3><u>Napoleonic War and Sweden</u><h3>
              <p>In 1803, Britain declared war on France. France was going through a revolution and did away with its monarchy. Napoleon Bonaparte ruled the country and killed Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien who tried to aid Britain in the war and reinstate the monarchy. The killing of Louis Antoine angered many nations across Europe, many seeing France as a threat to the monarchy system which was the dominant form of government in that era. Wanting to end Napoleon’s rule, Sweden joined the Third Coalition with Prussia and Great Britain and declared war on France. Charles XIV John of Sweden made an agreement with Russia, by allying themselves with Tsar Alexander I, Sweden was promised protection by Russia if Napoleon ever attacked their lands and Norway as compensation for the loss of Finland. Sweden would then negotiate with England, by participating in the final assault against France, England would allow Sweden’s conquest for Norway. So, with Russia’s protection and both theirs and England’s approval for Norwegian conquest, Sweden was able to aid their allies across northern Europe. Charles John was made commander of the allied north army but “he used this army sparingly, especially the Swedish contingent, even at the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813, because he cherished a hope of succeeding Napoleon and also because he needed troops to attack Denmark.” Charles led his troop against Denmark and won and signed the treaty of Kiel, Norway was surrendered to Sweden.</p>

            <h3><u>World Wars and Neutrality</u></h3>
            <p>Following the devastating defeat from Russia, Sweden decided to remain neutral in future affairs. During World War II, Sweden was a neutral party towards the war along with several other nations. They did help refugees and tended to soldiers wounds from both sides of the war, but they never got involved militarily. As a rule for nations wishing to remain neutral, you can not aid any nation, either with troops or military access to your land, yet, Germany was able to invade Norway by going through Sweden’s land. After the coup d'etat in Norway, Sweden was cut off from trade to other westner nations and had to rely on german trade which many viewed as a breach of neutrality. </p>

                  <h3><u>Post World War II and Cold War</u></h3>
                  <p>In 1946, Sweden joined the United Nations which was founded one year prior. “The U.N.  was established -- to maintain international peace and security; to foster cooperation in solving international economic, social, cultural, and humanitarian problems; to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; to develop friendly relations among nations; and to be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations in attaining common goals..." Sweden did not join any other alliance however as they wish to remain neutral. During the Cold War, Sweden didn’t take a side with either the U.S. or the USSR but did however maintain a closer tie with the U.S. in fear of Soviet aggression. After the Cold War, Sweden joined the EU but did not change their currency to the Euro. </p>

          <h3><u>Modern day Sweden</u></h3>
          <p>Today Sweden is one of the most innovative countries in the world, known for making three-point seatbelt, Spotify, and Skype. They are a very secular country but have most of the world religions represented. They hold a high regard to the environment and almost everything in Sweden is used somehow including trash. Trash is used as a heating source for the winter, and only 1% of solid wastes goes to landfill in Sweden. They are known for using renewable resources like windmills and solar panels.
