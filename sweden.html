          <h3><u>Geography</u></h3>
          <p>The country of Sweden is mostly flat with an abundance of forest and islands. Itâ€™s really snowy and mountainous in the northwestern part of the country which separates it from Norway and has a long coastline next to the Gulf of Bothnia and the Baltic Sea allowing it to trade with various different countries. Sweden has always, since its existence been a sea fishing and trading country. Its large abundance of fishing resources contributed to the creation of Vikings and raised Sweden to become a major power during the 7th and 8th century. </p>

          <h3><u>Norse Religion</u></h3>
          <p>The Swedes along with all other scandinavian tribes before and during the age of the viking followed the Norse religion. The Norse religion is polytheistic, there are two distinct groups of gods, Aesir and Vanir. The Aesir are chaotic and warlike, ruling over Asgard, while Vanir are peace-loving gods and are associated with fertility and nature, ruling over Vanaheimr. In the Norse faith, there exist nine worlds, Asgard, Alfheim, Midgard, Vanaheim, Jotunheim, Niflheim, Muspellsheim, Svartalfheim, and Helheim. All of these worlds are connected to one another through Yggdrasil, a cosmic tree of life that connects all of the worlds through its branches and roots. All living people are leaves of Yggdrasil, leaves that fall represent lives lost, while new budding leaves are new life that was born. The main god of the faith was Odin, he was called the All-Father because he was the father keen with knowledge and wisdom. He was also the ruler of Asgard. Odin saw in his prophecy Ragnarok, the end of the world, in a war between Aesir god against Hel and Loki, the trickster god.
