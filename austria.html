          <h3><u>History of Austria</u></h3>
          <p>The landlocked country of Austria is located in central Europe. It has a long history of wars, diverse culture, and a mix of different regions in one. It was once the most influential country in all of Europe. Renowned for its many Holy Roman Emperors, and political marriages and unions, Austria is a grand country that grew to magnificent heights, fell from its pedestal and reformed into a republic that is growing steadily after its collapse.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
          <h3><u>Geography</u></h3>
          <p>The country of Austria is made up of three different landscapes. The lowland towards the east and southeast portion of the country (used mostly for agriculture), forested hills and low mountains to the north which borders the Czech Republic, and the Alps mountains to the west which covers the majority of the country. The Alps makes it difficult for the country to produce a lot of food which causes the country to focus more on service and industry. The country borders the Czech Republic, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Hungary, Italy, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Germany. The country is landlocked and has no access to the coast. However, the country’s capital, Vienna, is next to the Danube river which contributed to many artists, musicians, opera singers, literature, and cultural institutions.  They also use it for trading which helped with development which helped Austria to become the country that it is today. </p>

          <h3><u>Austrian Empire</u></h3>
          <p>	The land of Austria before it was called that, was ruled by the  House of Habsburg for the majority of its existence from 1273 to 1806. The head of the Habsburg family ruled as emperor of the Holy Roman Empire which was a large union of multiple kingdoms to try and recreate the western side of the Roman Empire. When the Holy Roman Empire came to an end by Napoleon, The house of Habsburg unified under the name of Austria and became part of the new union call the German Confederation which rose to respond to the rise of the French Empire. Austria stayed until 1866, when it went to war with Prussia. The Austro-Prussian war (Seven weeks’ war) was a war between the Austrian Empire against the Prussian Empire and Italy. Austria had ruled over the Holy Roman Empire for a long time, however Prussia wanted to unite Germany under its rule and exclude Austria since they ruled as emperor for the majority of its existence. Austria lost the war and was excluded from the North German Confederation and lost Venetia to Italy. Losing to Prussia and Italy, Austria combined its strength with Hungary and created the Austro-Hungarian Empire in order to regain strength.

          <h3><u>World War I</u></h3>
          <p>Before WWI, Austria had forcefully occupied Bosnia-Herzegovina and annexed it as part of the empire. They wanted to become a major power in the Balkan and did so because Russia couldn’t retaliate because of its defeat to Japan during the Russo-Japanese war. Serbia saw this as a large unbalance in the Balkans and feared Austrian aggression would lead them there. There was a large nationalistic identity in both Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia. Russia encourage the nationalistic movement in Serbia and other Balkan state in order to resist Austria. This rose fear within Austria of a Slavic expansion and in January 1909, Austria made an alliance with Germany. Germany would back Austria against Russia and France if Austria declared war on Serbia and provoked them. The nationalist movement had taken away some land from Austria which threatened the aristocracy. When Austria’s Archduke, Franz Ferdinand was assassinated, Austria sent Serbia an ultimatum. When Serbia agreed to only some of the agreement, Austria declared war. Russia backed Serbia, which led Germany to back Austria by declaring war on Russia. France joined in defense of Russia, so Germany invaded Belgium in order to reach France. Great Britain joined in defense of Belgium and later, through a secret alliance, Italy joined in against Austria-Hungary. Japan, being in an alliance with Great Britain, also got involved in the war and took some German colonies in east Asia.  Austria was ill-equipped for a large continental war. Their multiple ethnicities and different language as well as a weak army made it hard to compete in the war against other major powers. In 1918, the Austria-Hungary empire collapsed and had to divide its land to Romania, Italy, and Liechtenstein. </p>

          <h3><u>July 1927 Revolt and Austria’s Annexation</u></h3>
          <p>After WWI, inflation occurred to the Krone, the Austrian currency, which caused the government to go nearly bankrupt. Austria became the First Republic of Austria and there was violent debate on how the country should be run. There was a revolt in July 1927 when right-wing paramilitaries who were found guilty of killing a man and a child were acquitted. When Austria’s chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss came into office, he ruled the country in an autocratic regime. Germany sent propaganda to try to have Austria unite with them. Finally in March 12, 1938, Nazi Germany occupied Austria and annexed it as part of Germany the following day. This was the end of the First Republic of Austria.</p>

          <h3><u>Allied Occupation of Austria and After</u></h3>
          <p>After the allied forces fought against Nazi Germany and won, they treated Austria as a liberated state and was considered an independent country. Austria, like Germany, was split into four separate sections controlled by France, Soviet Union, U.K0. and the U.S. Austria was occupied by the allies for a decade and was then given full independence in 1955. The country enforced neutrality by the Austrian state treaty and is unable to make any military alliance. The country had changed to become the Republic of Austria.  Currently the country is a lot smaller than it was during its peak and is no longer the same superpower as it once was. Austria is now a more peaceful nation and will not support any nation in any future wars.</p>
