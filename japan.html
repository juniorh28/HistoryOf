        <h3><bold>Contexts to History of: Japan</bold></h3>
        <div>
          <p>Japan, the land of the rising sun and home to the longest recorded reigning royal imperial family in the world. They are an exporter of culture and one of the world’s most innovative country, producing a majority of the world’s technology. Japan has a long history of warfare, spreading their influence to their neighboring countries. They have many beautiful castles and shrines that are centuries old. Japan is also one of the oldest countries maintaining an old homogeneous culture unlike any other in the world. They are also the only country to have a unique religion Shintoism.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3><u>Neolithic and Jomon Period</u></h3>
      <p>The earliest recorded people inhabiting Japan came from the paleolithic era, around 40,000-14,000 B.C.E and there’s human bones that radiocarbon dating suggests is around 14,000-18,000 years old. This was during the Ice Age where China and Japan were connected via land bridge through Hokkaido, and Korea and Japan through Kyushu. The Jomon Period is the period when the ice begins to melt and Japan becomes separated from mainland Asia to form the archipelago of present day Japan.  It’s also the earliest time period with archaeologists discovering evidence of pottery, jewels, and agriculture. It is believed that the Jomon people were limited to hunting, gathering, and fishing due to the location the site was discovered.</p>
        </div>    
    <div>
      <h3><u>Yayoi Period</u></h3>
      <p> The Yayoi period is Japan’s Iron age and agricultural revolution. This is the period when paddy fields started to appear in Japan and new tools made of metal replaced one made of stones for harvest. This also became the time when people started to settle and hunting or gathering was a supplement instead of a necessity. With food becoming more plentiful, societies started to form and towns and villages rose over nomadic life. A system of hierarchy had emerged, where your birth would determine who you would be in life. Those who owned farmland could feed other people, thus making others dependent on them and giving land owners vast amounts of power, those who were born from farmers or merchants would follow in their parents’ trade and there was no way to ascend from your social status. Clans started to form and warfare became more common for resources and more land, others made alliances and formed small kingdoms. There were taxes and an early form of law with punishments. “Metal ore supplies were quite limited in Japan at the time, so having metal items was indicative of higher status.” It was during this period that it was customary for “lower-ranking men to step to the side of the road to their social superior.” A tradition that lasted until the 19th century.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3><u>Kofun Period</u></h3>
          <p>The Yayoi period is followed by the Kofun period. This period is named after the famous acre long key shaped burial tombs in which the ruling elites were buried in. It is during this era that Japan started to follow Shinto. In the Shinto belief system, you connect to many gods, called Kami, through performance ritual. Kami inhabit natural power like the sun, sea, moon, storms and powerful humans, living or dead. The Yamato Clan was the strongest clan of the period controlling land from central Honshu to Northern Kyushu, having envoys in Korea and China, and having the strongest military. They rose to power politically through alliances and giving key positions to other clans to stay in power. And religiously, by worshipping and being descendants of one of the most important deity, Amaterasu, the sun goddess. Their success eventually led to the creation of the imperial family and giving way to the first emperor of Japan, the highest priest of the Shinto religion, and the ruler of the <strong><u>Chrysanthemum Throne</u></strong>.</p>
        </div>
      <div>
        <h3><u>Asuka and Nara Period</u></h3>
        <p>After the Kofun period came the Asuka and Nara period when Chinese influence dominated Japanese culture. The names of these periods are named after the provinces of the Yamato Clan. Japan adopted the Chinese writing system and implemented Buddhism as the state religion.  These two eras were when the arts flourished. Poems, art works, and literature were widespread throughout the island. It was also this era where the Fujiwara Clan, one of the three major families emerged. The Fujiwara Clan married into the imperial line and many of the emperors were born from the Fujiwara.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3><u>Heian Period</u></h3>
          <p>After the Nara era came the Heian period from 794-1185 A.D.  Heian is the old name of Kyoto. This is the age where the Fujiwara dominated the government. During the Heian period, Chinese influences started to wane and Japanese culture grew independently. This was also the rise of the Samurai class and the beginning of feudalism. During those times, it was not uncommon for an emperor to father many children. This would eventually lead to the process called “dynastic shedding”, where children would be removed from dynastic lineage and direct descendants would be given one of two family names,  Taira, or Minamoto, the other two powerful families in Japan. These two clans were both militarily powerful and bitter rivals. The Fujiwara, though having almost a complete monopoly of the throne, would eventually fail to stop emperor Go-Sanjo who was not born of Fujiwara descent from taking the throne. It was a common practice for a retired emperor to align himself with high aristocrats and pass policies or laws that were obeyed, essentially overruling the reigning emperor. This practice was called, insei. After losing the throne, the Fujiwara’s power went into decline. The reigning emperor implemented a system to end the practice, insei, which would weaken the Fujiwara’s power and absolute control. </p>
          </div>
        <div>
          <h3><u>Hogen and Heiji Disturbance</u></h3>
          <p>The reign of Fujiwara came to an end at the Hogen War in 1156, where the retired emperor Sutoku challenged the reigning emperor Go-Shirakawa for control. Reigning Emperor, Go-Shirakawa called for help from Taira Kiyomori and Minamito Yoshimoto to defeat Emperor Sutoku. Sutoku called the warrior and father to Yoshimoto, Minamoto Tameyoshi for aid. The war was won for emperor Go-Shirakawa but Taira Kiyomori received more credit for the war and gained more prestige than the emperor. This infuriated Yoshimoto, who felt he won the war for the emperor, not Kiyomori. Three years later, in 1159,  he, alongside his son, Minamoto Yoritomo, would later lead an assault against the capital. Yoshimoto’s revolt would be ended by Kiyomori, solidifying his control, with power and legitimacy. Losing the war, the Minamoto family was nearly wiped out and was banished from the imperial court. Yoritomo, still considered a boy, was spared and exiled to Izu providence where he would marry a woman from the Hojo clan. Taira Kiyomori would eventually further increase his power by marrying a favored consort,  (one of many spouses), of Shirakawa, and thus becoming an uncle to prince Mochihito. He used his newfound position to move his relatives into court positions and even got his daughter in the emperor’s bed, bearing him a grandson whom he enthroned as emperor, bypassing the legitimate heir. This enraged his nephew, prince Mochihito, and he would then call on the remaining Minamoto warriors to fight against the Taira. 
    </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3><u>Gempei War</u></h3>
            <p>Minamoto answered the call to arms and in 1180, the war was on. The war is known as “The Gempei War.” Through political sabotage, the Taira became the new imperial family. Not accepting their right to rule, the Minamoto challenged their authority throughout the country and marched onto Kyoto to face them head-on. The war lasted around 5 years, in which the country suffered a typhoon, earthquake, and famine. In the end, the Minamoto clan rose victorious and were declared the new imperial family of Japan. They created a new class called the Shogunate. It was awarded to the clan with the strongest military, economy, and lineage to the Minamoto family. The power of the shogun was so high that it held the emperor as a revered figurehead. After the death of Yoritomo, his wife’s family, the Hojo clan became the new shogunate. 
    </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3><u>The Hojo Clan and Restoration of Imperial Power</u></h3>
            <p>Over the centuries power shifted to one clan, the Hojo. They became very powerful when they defeated Emperor Go-Toba’s attempts to regain power. Towards the end of the 12th century, the Hojo’s power increased more when they were able to defeat the Mongol invasion of Japan. The battle at sea was won thanks to two furiously powerful typhoons. They were called Kamikaze which translate to “Divine Wind.” After the invasion, Hojo Tokimune, head of the Hojo clan during the Mongol invasion, converted to zen buddhism, building shrine to the fallen soldiers in the invasion. This led to Zen Buddhism being spread throughout Japan. Under Tokimune, he would combine Zen (which in simplest form is a way of finding self-discovery through mediation) with the warrior code of Bushido (which taught samurai to have the utmost loyalty and have to honor, and to die before dishonor).  In 1331, Emperor Go-Daigo rebelled against the Hojo but was eventually defeated and exiled to Oki Island. His followers kept fighting in his name and the following year, Emperor Go-Daigo returned and was victorious when Ashikaga Takauji of the Ashikaga clan betrayed the Hojo.  Following his victory, Go-Daigo, restored the emperor, as the true devine head of state and made the shogunate class subordinate permanently. He would later declare the imperial prince as Shogun which angered the Ashikaga.

          <div>
            <h3><u>Ashikaga Shogun and Separation of the Court</u></h3>
            <p>The Hojo Clan resurrected in 1335 and attacked Kyoto. Takauji personally went and quelled the rebellion by raising an army without the emperor’s consent. After the battle, Takauji started rewarding land to the soldiers to increase their loyalty to him which provoked the emperor. He would call Takauji a traitor and sent his forces against him. Ashikaga was pushed westward to Kyushu. Ashikaga Takauji was able to rally the local families there to join him, departing towards Kyoto with a larger army then he came with. He pushed the emperor into the mountain and fought hin to a stalemate. Tired of fighting, Emperor Go-Daigo gave him the imperial regalia which is necessary for legitimate succession. Takauji gave the regalia to prince Yakuhito in exchange to become shogun but rumors spread that the regalia was a fake and this lead to the splitting of the imperial court into two, north and south. Takauji would eventually defeat Go-Daigo’s forces. With the collapse of leadership in the southern court, the imperial court was reunited 60 years later in 1391 and emperor Komyo declared the Ashikaga clan shogun.

            <h3>Sengoku Jidai</h3>
            <p>Between the years 1338-1573, Japan was in a constant state of civil war. The Ashikaga shogun had lost influence over the local Daimyos (warlords) and didn’t have any power to stop it. Around this time, Portuguese traders came to the island, selling firearms and spreading christianity. The civil war was ended by the three unifiers of Japan, Oda Nobunaga, whose clan descended from the Taira, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who succeeded after the collapse of the Oda clan,  and Tokugawa Ieyasu, whose clan is descended from the Minamoto. Oda Nobunaga was considered the first unifier of Japan, he was also one of the first to use firearms in his army to advance his conquest. He made an alliance with Tokugawa, his neighbor and marched westward, controlling the majority of the land west of Japan and taking over Kyoto, the capital city of Japan to overthrow the current shogunate and proclaim himself as the new shogun. He was eventually betrayed and killed by one of his retainers, Akechi Mitsuhide. He reigned as shogun for 13 days before being killed by Nobunaga’s general Hideyoshi. Hideyoshi inherited the lands previously owned by the Oda Clan and with Tokugawa’s help, who owned the majority of the eastern half of Japan, they were then able to end the civil war.</p>

            <h3>Imjin War</h3>
            <p> Having ended the long civil war and uniting the country, Hideyoshi would later lead an invasion of Korea in a war called the Imjin War in 1592. Japan made it far in the Korean peninsula before being pushed back to sea by Korea and the aid of China. Despite having a vastly superior navy, Japan was defeated at sea because of one single Korean admiral, Yi Sun-Sin. Admiral Yi, created a new ship called the Turtle Ship, a small, fast moving ship with a spiked roof covering the ship and cannons on the broadside. They would ram into enemy vessels and fire their cannon before sailing away. The spike made it so that anyone attempting to board would be impaled and grappling hooks couldn’t get a hold of the ship. The most famous battle which highlighted their effectiveness was the battle of Myeongnyang, when Korea won a naval combat against 133 Japanese warships to 13 Korean turtle ships. The war ended in 1598 with Japan retreating back to their island, giving up all land gained in the war. </p>

          <div>
            <h3><u>Ieyasu and The Tokugawa Shogunate</u></h3>
            <p>Hideyoshi spawned a son late in life and died a few years after he was born. Hideyoshi’s land was divided amongst his generals including Tokugawa, who now had virtually full control of the county. He was to give back the land to the heir when he came of age. However, when the boy did come of age, Tokugawa sent his army to kill the boy in order to stay in full control. This led to a war between the Western Army of Toyotomi clan along with his loyalist, the Mori Clan, Shimazu clan and Chosokabe clan, against the Eastern Army of Tokugawa. In Osaka, the Mori clan had taken over Osaka castle and were fighting off the Tokugawa attempt to regain it. At the battle of Sekigahara, the battle was in favor of Tokugawa and was made definite when some of the generals of the Western Army defected, which turned the tide to a Tokugawa victory. This led to the Tokugawa shogunate and the banishment of the three clans from the imperial court who fought against the Tokugawa before their rise to power. Mori were stripped of their home province of Aki and sent to Choshu, even though they weren’t part of the battle of Sekigahara. Chosokabe were stripped of their family name and exiled, and the Shimazu while not exiled, were also not loyal to the new shogun and took advantage of their distance from their home province of Satsuma to rule themselves independently. Japan was now about to enter an era of peace, until the peace was halted by a revolt because of high taxes. Peasants, along with Christians captured a castle in Nagasaki. The rebellion was quelled by the imperial navy and a strict prohibition on Christianity was enforced. </p>

            <h3><u>Rise of Tokyo and Isolationism</u></h3>
        <p> During the mid 1600s, while the rest of the world was freely trading and benefiting from parts of the new world, Japan set a policy of isolationism to stop the spread of Christianity. The policy lasted for 200 years, in which no one was allowed into the country except for Dutch traders and even they were limited to where they could go throughout the island. While the emperor resided in Kyoto, the shogunate resided in Edo, the city that would eventually be renamed Tokyo, the new capital of Japan. The shogun held absolute power while the emperor was just a figurehead. Because there was no more wars being fought, many Daimyos brought tribute to Edo helping it grow and become a powerful city in hope of gaining favor from the shogun. During the years in isolation, The shogun created the Red Seal Ship system. A policy which armed merchant ships with red sealed permits authorizing them to trade outside of Japan. The ships were protected by the shogun, they had red sails to help distinguish them from other ships. The policy worked in reducing piracy because it would mean that the pirates or nation would be pursued by the shogun’s forces. It was also during this time when the Yakuza is believed to have been founded. Because no wars were being fought, samurais were falling into debt while merchants were getting richer even though they were lower in terms of social standing. This led to many ronins, which are masterless samurais, to resort to banditry and gambling, and eventually joining the yakuza. The yakuza is a criminal organization that was founded from two seperate groups, the tekiya or the untouchables, Japan’s lowest in the social hierarchy, and the bakuto or the gamblers. The bakuto often had full body tattoos which is a custom for modern day yakuza. Around the mid 1700s, the Tokugawa shogun allowed takiya bosses to have the title oyabun, which are officially acknowledged bosses. They were acknowledged as the head of their takiya family and were allowed to carry swords and have a surname, privileges allowed before only for samurais.

          <h3><u>Boshin War and The Last Samurai</u></h3>
          <p>While many countries were in the industrial age, Japan remained stuck in the past.  They weren’t fully oblivious to the advancements of other nations. In the western part of the country, there was a practice of western teachings called Rangaku, or Dutch teachings. This showed the impact of the industrial revolution to the Choshu and Satsuma Clan. In the other side of the ocean, America, having annexed California, allowed them access to the Pacific coast, and the opening of Chinese ports created a steady stream of trade between the two nations. Because of their distance from one another, America needed coal and a safe harbor to dock ships in case of refuelings and shipwrecks. Japan was rich in coal supplies and was an ideal place to dock towards China. On July 8, 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry from the United States of America, gave the Japanese government an ultimatum, which threatened them to open their ports or face an attack from the US with their ironclad warships if they refused. The threat led to the shogunate, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, to sign the treaty of Kanagawa on March 31, 1854, which greatly favored western powers, without the approval of the emperor, the divine head of state of Japan. 
“According to the terms of the treaty, Japan would protect stranded seamen and open two ports for refueling and provisioning American ships: Shimoda and Hakodate. Japan also gave the United States the right to appoint consuls to live in these port cities, a privilege not previously granted to foreign nations.”
The growing amount of foreigners caused discontent to the Japanese citizens and divided the country. This led emperor Komei to overrule the shogun’s decision and ordered the expulsion of “barbarians” from Japan. This led to another civil war for power between the emperor and the shogun, which many European nations profited from, supplying both sides with arms and training. The three clans who were banished from the imperial court joined in a coalition against the shogun in order to restore the emperor in power in order to become influential once again. The imperial army was led by Saigo Takamori, who pushed the shogunate all the way to Hokkaido where they tried to create a new nation called the Republic of Ezo. They sent a peace treaty to the emperor which was denied and they were eventually defeated, restoring full power to the emperor. The government would eventually implement widespread modernization throughout the country. Saigo, who won victory for the emperor, pleaded to have only the army modernize, but not the economy. He was dismissed and would then lead a samurai rebellion against the new government, recruiting dissatisfied samurais who lost their privileges and social standing. He used many modern tactics and weaponry until he ran out of ammunition and had to rely on his sword and bow at the battle of Shiroyama. It was there where he fought his last stand against the imperial army. He was declared, “The Last Samurai” and was pardoned by the government due to his popularity throughout the country.

          <h3><u>Meiji Restoration and Japan’s Modernization</u></h3>
          <p>    Throughout the civil war, which ended on June 27, 1869, Japan saw the necessity to industrialize and underwent rapid modernization and planned a constitution that would launch the country forward, meriting the respect of Western powers. The Meiji Restoration had numerous effects on Japan such as the abolishment of the feudal hierarchy system and declaring all classes equal. For the military, there were many reforms, the daimyos and samurais were seen as obsolete and were disbanded, losing all their special privileges. The soldiers now fought in unison under the name of the emperor instead of feudal lords. The military, though reformed, kept some of the code of Bushido. This was after the fall of the Satsuma rebellion, after seeing how the changes had caused the rebels to fight to the death in order to preserve tradition and honor, the government decided to pardon them and implement some of Bushido’s teaching in a way to preserve national identity. For the economy, factories, railways, and automobiles were on the rise all across the country. Communication was widespread with telegraphs spread all across the nation. The private sector grew and many people rose above their once lower social standing. The Industrial sector grew based on the latest technology propelling Japan to have the most modern Army and Navy in Asia at the time. Educationally, Japan had been sending students abroad to learn western teachings to implement in the country and in 1871, the ministry of Education was founded and the Japanese government paid for public education encouraging a smarter population. They modeled the American system and the French centrally-controlled administration system. In April, 1882, Prince Ito Hirobumi, traveled abroad on tour of several constitutional systems of government, spending most of his time in Germany, studying the system of Bismark. In 1889, the Meiji Constitution was founded, which created The Imperial Diet, the name for the government. The Diet is an elected parliament which has two parties, the Upper House and an elected Lower House, and a prime minister position. “They did this to provide a good environment for national growth, win the respect of the Westerners, and build support for the modern state.” This was also a way to change the unfavorable treaties Japan signed.

          <h3><u>The Rise of an Empire: Sino-Japanese War and Russo-Japanese War  </u></h3>
          <p> The  practice of “Gunboat Diplomacy” that Western nations used on various nations was also used against Korea by the Japanese. Japan after modernizing their economy, military and navy, and centralizing their government, used gunboat diplomacy on Korea wanting to own land in the region for natural resources  and show its might as an imperial nation equal to that other imperializing nations. In 1876, Japan forced Korea to sign the Treaty of Kanghwa, an unfair treaty to the Koreans which gave Japan, “special trading rights and other privileges in Korea that were not reciprocated for Koreans in Japan”, as well forcing Korea to declare independence from China’s influence.  The Japanese occupation of Korea interfered with China’s sphere of influence which led to conflict between both nations in a war known as the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 for supremacy over Korea. The war was a defeat for the Chinese Empire and showed signs of Chinese weakness that was exploited by Japan and other western countries. The end of the war resulted in Japan gaining the following: the province of Liaodong Peninsula in Manchuria, Taiwan and its surrounding islands, and 200 million taels(Chinese silver currency) of indemnity(war reparations). Japan’s territorial gains in Liaodong interfere with Russia’s economic interest in the area. Russia was working on the Trans-Siberian Railroad to connect Moscow to Vladivostok and was given permission by the Chinese Empire to go through Manchuria. On April 23, 1895, Russia, France, and Germany forced Japan to recede lands in the Liaodong peninsula in what was called the Triple Intervention. After the Sino-Japanese War, China sought loans from Russia to pay Japan and was forced to leased Manchuria in a secret treaty. This was an insult and a sign of humiliation to Japan to have land they receded because of Russian intervention under the premise of peace in East Asia, be controlled by them. This rivalry led to Japan to seek an alliance with Great Britain in 1902 called the Anglo-Japanese alliance. Both parties agreed on two major points, if either nation declared war on a different nation, then the opposing party would stay neutral, and if either party were declared war upon by more than one country, the other would join in defense of the other (with Russia, France, or Germany in mind). For Britain, this alliance helped to limits Russia’s expansion in China and would allows Japan to declared a surprise war on Russia in 1904-1905 without fear of France (Russia’s ally) joining in defence of Russia. Japan and Russia fought in both Manchuria and in the Sea of Japan. Russia, brought its naval units a vast journey from the Baltic, around Africa, across the Indian Ocean, through the Malaysian strait to the Sea of Japan to engage Japanese warships at the Battle of Tsushima. Russia lost to Japan, marking the first time a European navy lost to an Asian power. The loss of Russian fleets, loss of men, internal political affairs in Russia, and stacking economic and financial issues for both parties, led both nations into a peace talk that was brokered by the U.S and President Roosevelt. The two countries eventually signed the Treaty of Portsmouth, in which all agreed on the following terms: Japan would gain control of the Liaodong peninsula including Port Arthur, much of Southern Manchuria including parts of the railroad, Southern half of the Sakhalin Island, and U.S recognition of Japan sovereignty to rule over Korea.

          <h3><u>WWI</u></h3>
          <p>Japan renewed their defensive agreement with Britain for another ten years and in 1914, Japan joined in Britain’s defence against the Central Powers in WWI. The Japanese army took control of German holding in China. The navy coordinated with the British and provided escort support against German U-boats in the Mediterranean and led an assault on German colonies in the South East Pacific and Oceaniania. Throughout the war, Japan took advantage of the crisis to threaten China with 21 Points demands which would increase Japan’s strength, power, and influence in mainland China. Some of the most import points was in Group I, Article II which states: “The Chinese Government engage that, within the province of Shantung or along its coast, no territory or island will be ceded or leased to any other Power, under any pretext whatever.”
That China is not give its territory or island to any foreign nation under any circumstances. After the end of the war, during the signing of the Treaty of Versailles of June 28, 1919, Japan was given full control over former Germany province, Shantung in China. However, during the Washington Naval Conference of 1921-22, Japan agreed to the treaties which was aimed at naval disarmament and to reduce tension in Asia. Two important treaties was the Four-Power treaty which saw the end of the Anglo-Japanese defensive agreement and the Nine-Power Japan’s which saw Japan’s withdrawal from Shantung and restoring China’s former territories and equal trade in China amongst all nations.
