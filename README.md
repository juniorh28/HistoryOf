# HistoryOf

This is a website using html, css, and js. 

https://juniorh28.github.io/HistoryOf/

Purpoes: to test my abilities, to create a live environment for my articles where others may read and learn.
 
Need to tweak: 

1. must work on making the site mobile-friendly 
2. separating the content into mutiple pages. Done!
3. make the article table a part of the  naviagation tab
